\section intro Introduction

COUWBAT provides a wireless backbone for wireless small cells based on a wideband overlay Cognitive Radio technology. The system is designed by:

 - Telecommunication Networks Group, Technical University Berlin
 - AED Engineering GmbH (AED)

The TKN Technical Report *Overlay Cognitive Radio for Small-Cell Backhauling â€“ R&D Project COUWBAT* gives a detailed description of the original COUWBAT idea and design. Since then there have been many changes to how the COUWBAT system works.
